What types of code example are available?
There are four types of code example available on MDN:

Static examples — plain code blocks, possibly with a screenshot to statically show the result of such code if it were to be run.
Traditional MDN "live samples" — A macro that takes plain code blocks, dynamically puts them into a document inside an <iframe> element, and embeds it into the page to show the code running live.
GitHub "live samples" — A macro that takes a document in a GitHub repo inside the mdn organization, puts it inside an <iframe> element, and embeds it into the page to show the code running live.
Interactive examples — Our system for creating live interactive examples that show the code running live but also allow you to change code on the fly to see what the effect is.
We'll discuss each one in later sections.
