 [Man Narrating] Listen, here's the thing.

            If you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table,

            then you are the sucker.

            Guys around here'll tell ya... you play for a living.

            It's like any other job. You don't gamble. You grind it out.

            Your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.

            Get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.

            Don't give anything away.

            That's how I've paid my way through half of law school.

            A true grinder.

            See, I learned how to win a little at a time. But finally, I've learned this...

            If you're too careful, your whole life can become a fuckin' grind.

            This is Teddy KGB's place.

            - [Man] Five hundred. - You won't find it in the Yellow Pages.

            Nope. Not tonight.

            No? What?

            Give me three stacks of high society.
